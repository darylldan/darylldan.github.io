	<h3> Daryll Dan C. Caponpon<h3/>
	<p> Hello I am Daryll Dan C. Caponpon! I am a BS Computer Science student and I am learning web development!<p/>
	<hr>
	<p> You can call me <p/>
	<h3> Daryll <h3/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite CMSC Subject <h3/>
	<p> CMSC 123 is my favorite subject so far. It is challenging but it is so satisfying seeing your code throw anything other than "segmentation fault".<p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite GE <h3/>
	<p> I found ETHICS 1 a lot of fun because its like having your shower thoughts discussed among the class. <p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite PL <h3/>
	<p> I guess "the more you hate, the more you love" is true since I think C is my favorite programming language. Or I am just gaslighted by the pointers that is haunting me everytime I didn't clear them.<p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite Food <h3/>
	<p> Shawarma is my favorite food. Everything about it is perfect. The intense flavor of the meat, the crunchy cucumbers, and the sause to top it all. <p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Hobbies <h3/>
	<p> I love doing graphics design as evident by the aesthetics of this page (jk i just haven't learned css yet). I also love playing guitar and playing video games <p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Childhood dream <h3/>
	<p> Back then I wanted to be an astronaut as I was amazed by the stars at night. Books about planets excites me. But I found out that you have to be very good at science and math to be one, so I dropped it. <p/>
