	<h3> Daryll Dan C. Caponpon<h3/>

	<h3> Favorite CMSC Subject <h3/>
	<p> CMSC 123 is my favorite subject so far. It is challenging but it is so satisfying seeing your code throw anything other than "segmentation fault".<p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite GE <h3/>
	<p> I found ETHICS 1 a lot of fun because its like having your shower thoughts discussed among the class. <p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite PL <h3/>
	<p> I guess "the more you hate, the more you love" is true since I think C is my favorite programming language. Or I am just gaslighted by the pointers that is haunting me everytime I didn't clear them.<p/>
	<hr>
	<h3> Favorite Food <h3/>
	<p> Shawarma is my favorite food. Everything about it is perfect. The intense flavor of the meat, the crunchy cucumbers, and the sause to top it all. <p/>
